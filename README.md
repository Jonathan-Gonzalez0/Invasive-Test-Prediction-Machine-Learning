# Invasive-Test-Prediction-Machine-Learning

Created a logistic regression and solved it using 4911 data points of two low cost and non-invasive tests that predicted the chances of a nano-processor passing a high cost and very inavsive test with an accuracy o 99.69%.
Project was developed in Spyder.
