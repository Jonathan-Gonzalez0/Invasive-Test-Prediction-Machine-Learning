# Invasive-Test-Prediction-Machine-Learning

Created a logistic regression and solved it using 4911 data points of two low cost and non-invasive tests that predicted the chances of a nano-processor passing a high cost and very inavsive test with an accuracy of 99.69%.
Project was developed in Spyder. 
3 models were created, the most accurate model can be found in "HW6part2Model1.py".
Make sure to have non_inavive_tests_results.txt in the same folder as the file intented to run.
